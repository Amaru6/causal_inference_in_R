# causal_inference_in_R

In this repository I have my notes and implementations of the course **A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data**. 
I primarily rely on tidyverse functions and the fixest package for IV. Also, This repo contains my solutions of the data projects from the course.
